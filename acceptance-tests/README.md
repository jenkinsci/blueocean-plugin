# Acceptance tests for Blue Ocean

## System Requirements

### Operating Systems

Linux and macOS are currently the only supported OS. Windows support is not available at this time.

### Dependencies

`libxml2-utils` and `libssl-dev` are needed by the node packages.

Maven 3.3+ and JDK8 are required to run the tests.

## Acceptance Tests

Please make sure that BlueOcean plugins are built correctly. If _funky_ things seem to be happening in ATH, try running the following command from the top level blueocean directory

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests -DcleanNode
```

### Areas covered

* Karaoke parallel: ParallelNavigationTest. This checks that users can navigate between concurrently executing parallel branches, including steps waiting for input.
* Commit Messages: CommitMessagesTest checks to see that commit messages of git commits are shown on a run
* Folder Names: FoldersTest checks that folders with special characters work correctly in Blue Ocean
* Github integration: GithubCreationTests cover github integration testing of both the creation flow and also simple editor round tripping.

### Run all tests (in one command)
 ```bash
./run.sh
```

This is mainly for CI servers. It starts the selenium docker container and runs all java ATH tests in one shot.

If Docker cannot start the bitbucket test, you can try this option
 ```bash
./run.sh -ld
```

### Run tests against a local instance

ATH looks for a properties file at `~/.blueocean-ath-config` (or any combination of similar command line options).
These options will allow you to run a local [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/),
 for example, and execute the ATH against a local development instance
that you can debug/etc.. Currently these properties are supported and/or necessary:
```
webDriverType=chrome
webDriverUrl=http://localhost:9515
webDriverBrowserSize=1024x768 (optional)
jenkinsUrl=http://localhost:8080/jenkins (optional)
adminUsername=admin (optional)
adminPassword=admin (optional)
```

### Run tests in DEV mode

DEV mode starts Jenkins and the selenium docker container running in a standalone mode.
This allows for individual tests to be run against the server multiple times, which makes
writing ATH tests much easier.

First, start the server:
```bash
./run.sh --dev (-ld)
```

Next run the desired tests

#### Java Webdriver Tests via Maven

Maven has 5 profiles set up for running tests. The default profile runs the offline tests.
The `live` profile runs tests that need services like GitHub, and the `all` profile will run all of them. Finally there
are the `nightwatch` and `offlineAll` profiles which run the nightwatch tests and run the nightwatch  + offline tests respectively.

Specific tests can be specified with `-Dtest=`.
```bash
mvn clean test
mvn clean test -Dprofile=live
mvn clean test -Dprofile=offlineAll
mvn clean test -Dprofile=all
mvn clean test -Dprofile=all -Dtest=FavoritesTest
```

Note: to run the live tests, there needs to be a `live.properties` file in the acceptance-tests directory.

```properties
github.repo=<name of repository to be created
github.org=<org or user name to create repo in.>
github.token=<personal access token (roles: repo, user:email, and optionally delete_repo)>
github.deleteRepo=<true/false should the code delete repo once test is done>
github.randomSuffix=<true/false - add a random suffix to repo name (ie must have for CI>
```

#### Java Webdriver Tests via IntelliJ (and probably other IDEs)

Running tests via the IDE works as expected as long as the standalone part of the ATH is running.

To start a test in IntelliJ the easiest way is to right click on the test class or method and click Run test.

NOTE: if you have a `~/.blueocean-ath-config` it will be used when running tests this way.

## Writing Tests

### Java Webdriver tests

#### IntelliJ

Make sure you add the acceptance-tests to your intellij blueocean project by right-clicking on `acceptance-tests/pom.xml`
and adding it to the project.

### WebDriverMixin

There is a `WebDriverMixin` that can help simplify writing tests significantly. It offers a number of
utility methods for the most common operations, all which have logic added to deal with common problems
in Blue Ocean such as animation.

It is recommended you use this when writing tests.

A simple example:

```java
import io.blueocean.ath.WebDriverMixin;

public class LoginTest implements WebDriverMixin {
    @Test
    public void login() {
        // go: goes to a relative jenkins path or absolute if starts with http(s)://
        go("/login");
        // find: waits for elements to be preset, if starts with / uses xpath, otherwise CSS selectors
        find("#j_username") // find by ID when starts with #, this is just a CSS selector
            // setText: clears, sets text on an input
            .setText("admin");
        find("input[name=j_password]") // just a CSS selector
            .setText("admin");
        // click: handles animation, failures will retry up to 2 times
        click("//form[@name='login']//button"); // XPath selector
        // other utilities, see io.blueocean.ath.WebDriverMixin
        assert find("//a[contains(@href, 'logout')]").isDisplayed() : "Not logged in";
    }
}
```

#### JUnit4 Tests

All test code uses Guice to do dependency injection.

```java
//Makes the browser login at the start of every test in this class.
@Login
// Sets up the Guice DI and creates the WebDriver istan
@RunWith(ATHJUnitRunner.class)
@UseModules(AthModule.class)
public class MyFirstATHTest{

    // Base url for the browser to navigate to. e.g driver.get(baseUrl + "/blue/")
    @Inject @BaseUrl
    String baseUrl;

    // Helper functions for webdriver
    @Inject
    WaitUtil wait;

    // Incase direct access to the driver instance is needed
    @Inject
    Webdriver driver;

    // Page objects are injectable too
    @Inject
    DashboardPage dashboardPage;

    // Creates a temporary git repository to use in this test
    @Rule
    @Inject
    GitRepositoryRule repository;

    @Test
    public void myFirstTest() {
        dashboardPage.open();

        // Waits for 10s for the url to contain the string pipelines.
        wait.until(ExpectedConditions.urlContains("pipelines"));

        wait.until(By.cssSelector("button.some.clazz"));
            .click();
    }
}
```
#### Server Side Events

`SSEClient` is a JUnit `ExternalResource`. Once it is injected and marked as a rule on the test
it connects to the Jenkins server want waits for job events. Events are saved into a list as they happen.

Once a test is ready to check for events, `untilEvent()` can be used. `clear()` can be invoked at any time to clear out any
messages received until that point in time.

```java
@Login
@RunWith(ATHJUnitRunner.class)
@UseModules(AthModule.class)
public class MySecondATHTest{

    @Rule
    @Inject
    SSEClientRule sseClient;

    @Test
    public void mySecondTest() {
       // ... do something that makes a build run.

       // This waits for any builds that have been queued to finish.
       sseClient.untilEvents(SSEEvents.activityComplete(pipelineName));
       // Clear all events so far so that when wait is called again it doesn't see the old events.
       sseClient.clear();

       // ... some more run stuff
       sseClient.untilEvents(SSEEvents.activityComplete(pipelineName));

       // .. finish off test
    }
}
```
#### Page Objects

Page Objects allow for selectors and actions to be grouped into reusable classes.

```java
@Singleton
public class MyAwesomePage {

    @Inject
    WaitUtil wait;
    // PageFactory.initElements drivers the @Findby annotations. TBD if we want to use these TBH
    @Inject
    public MyAwesomePage(WebDriver driver) {
        PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
    }

    // Use annotation to find the WebElement instead of driver.findElement
    @FindBy(xpath = "//span[text()='Awesome']")
    public WebElement myAwesomeButton;

    public void clickAwesomeButton() {
        // Make sure the button is visible
        wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOf(myAwesomeButton));
        myAwesomeButton.click()

        // Check to see if another element is selected using the By selector.
        WebElement somethingElse = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("somethingElse")));
        somethingElse.isSelected();
    }
}
```

Any new Page Object classes need to be bound in `ATHModule#configure` to be able to be injected via Guice.

#### Pipeline Helper

These are a series of helpers to deal with pipelines. They started life to deal with pipelines being in folders. It offers a way
to give PageObjects more contextual information about what they are operating on without having to be explicit about it in every method call.

```java

@Login
@RunWith(ATHJUnitRunner.class)
@UseModules(AthModule.class)
public class MySecondATHTest{

    @Inject
    MultiBranchPipelineFactory mbpFactory;

    @Rule
    @Inject
    public GitRepositoryRule git;


    @Rule
    @Inject
    public SSEClientRule sseClient;

    @Test
    public void mySecondTest() {
        // Sets up the pipeline model with folders and a job name
        MultiBranchPipeline pipeline = mbpFactory.pipeline(Folder.folders("afolder", "bFolder"), "pipelineName");

        // Creates the pipeline in jenkins using the git repository rule.
        pipeline.createPipeline(git);

        // Wait for all runs to finish on the pipeline. Including all branches.
        sseClient.untilEvents(pipeline.buildsFinished);

        // Builds a bunch
        pipeline.buildBranch("master");

        // Opens the activity page for this pipeline and verifies its not 404.
        pipeline.getActivityPage().open();
        // Stops any runsa that are currently running on any branch job.
        pipeline.stopAllBuilds();

    }
}
```
